# Wordle-Aid
This app provides a way for people to cheat a little bit at
the well known game Wordle without looking up the word. The app
gives you a list of possible answers without explicitly giving
away the answer.

## How to Use
Type the words guessed in the Wordle game into the Aid's text
box and hit enter. Then click each letter to toggle the color to match 
the feedback given from the actual Wordle game. Once you are ready hit the
generate words button. A list of possible words will be generated
for you to guess from.

You can continue to enter words and generate lists. Use the clear
button to reset everything.
